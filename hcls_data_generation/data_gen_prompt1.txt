This is the article of a research and the columns for sql database table of genomic data, and the columns for survival information of chemotherapy patients with corresponding comments. The main table is table of genomic data and the chemotherapy survival table is mostly a table with some additioanl supporting information.

I am trying to come up with a dataset to test an ai agent for RAG and Text2sql capabilities. The dataset needs to be in a trajectory format, and each trajectory has to have 1 or more questions that are all related to the same topic and ideally the succeeding question should depend on the preceeding question. This is the format of the trajectory dataset.
"Trajectory1" : [
{
"question_id": 0,
"question_type": "RAG",
"question": "",
"ground_truth": ""
},
{
"question_id": 1,
"question_type": "TEXT2SQL",
"question":"",
"ground_truth": {
    "ground_truth_sql_query": "SELECT `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)` FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda' ORDER BY (CAST(`Free Meal Count (K-12)` AS REAL) / `Enrollment (K-12)`) DESC LIMIT 1",
    "ground_truth_sql_context": (Database schema related to the query for answering the question)
    "ground_truth_query_result": (Answer to the ground truth sql query),
    "ground_truth_answer": (Ground truth for the answer to the question)
}
}
]

I gave you a research article about biomarker, as well as the schema for the sql database related to the research.  Can you generate trajectory datasets, each trajectory must have 2 or more questions, and each trajectory should use both RAG and Text2sql functionality to build on preceeding question in the same trajectory.

For RAG questions, start the question with a "According to the knowledge base"
For Text2SQL questions, start the question with a "According to the database"

Give me a mix of simpler trajectorys as well as slightly more complex trajectories
