I have given you some sample text to sql and RAG question and ground truth.
I am trying to come up with a dataset to test an ai agent for RAG and Text2sql capabilities. The dataset needs to be in a trajectory format, and each trajectory has to have 1 or more questions that are all related to the same topic and ideally the succeeding question should depend on the preceeding question. This is the format of the trajectory dataset.
Use the list of question and ground truth pair I gave you to give me trajectories in the format below.

"Trajectory1" : [
{
"question_id": 0,
"question_type": "RAG",
"question": "",
"ground_truth": ""
},
{
"question_id": 1,
"question_type": "TEXT2SQL",
"question":"",
"ground_truth": {
    "ground_truth_sql_query": "SELECT `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)` FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda' ORDER BY (CAST(`Free Meal Count (K-12)` AS REAL) / `Enrollment (K-12)`) DESC LIMIT 1",
    "ground_truth_sql_context": (Database schema related to the query for answering the question)
    "ground_truth_query_result": (Answer to the ground truth sql query),
    "ground_truth_answer": (Ground truth for the answer to the question)
}
}
]

For RAG questions, start the question with a "According to the knowledge base"
For Text2SQL questions, start the question with a "According to the database"

Give me a mix of simpler trajectorys as well as slightly more complex trajectories
